Bump `vitest` (and its transitive `@vitest/mocker`) from 3.2.7 to 4.1.11 across every workspace to close GHSA-82fw-gwwq-j7x9 (path traversal / arbitrary file read via `@vitest/mocker`'s redirect mock), a dev-only dependency (Dependabot alerts #1–7, all moderate). 4.1.11 was published 2026-09-15, clearing D-49's 2-day release-age cooldown without an exclude entry.

Vitest 4 removed the separate `vitest.workspace.ts` file; the five test projects (`domain`, `contracts`, `db`, `web`, `ui`) now live under `test.projects` in `vitest.config.ts`. `packages/ui` gained `@types/node` and `"node"` in its `tsconfig.json` `types` array, restoring the `process.env.NODE_ENV` typing in `src/motion/gsap.ts` that vitest 3's type chain had been pulling in incidentally. No runtime behaviour change; `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm --filter @acadigma/web build` are green.
