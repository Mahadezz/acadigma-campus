F-ID-09 Parts 1-3 (audit viewer): the audit substrate — richer `audit_events` columns (actor_kind, subject_user_id, changed_fields, severity, hashed request IP), `app.audit_action_catalog` with the F-ID-09 §5.1 action catalogue and a CI parity check against its TypeScript mirror, a universal secret deny-list plus a free-text-nulling mechanism in the generic audit trigger, `audit_events_view` as the sole read surface, and correlation-id threading via a PostgREST pre-request hook — plus the owner-facing audit viewer at `/app/audit` (filterable list, detail sheet with a redacted diff, and the correlation/per-record history views).
